It has a stainless steel frame and glass on both its front and rear sides. The glass type is Corning Gorilla Glass 6, which is durable. Furthermore, the panels are covered with oleophobic coating, preventing smudges and fingerprints.</p><p class=align-left>The front section does not have a bezel, but it has a notch which houses the Face ID feature, speaker and selfie camera. The back section has a camera hump at the top left corner while the Apple logo is at the center.</p><h3>Display</h3><p class=align-left>iPhone Xs Max has one of the largest screen sizes of an iPhone with 6.5 inches, which is approximately 102.9 square centimeters in area. The screen display technology is Super Retina OLED capacitive touchscreen, and it is protected using Corning Gorilla Glass 6. It also has an oleophobic coating as protection from scratch and smudge.

The chipset is an improvement of the A11 Bionic, and it can do up to 5 trillion operations every second.</p><p class=align-left>It has a powerful CPU which is hexa-core (2x2.5 GHz Vortex + 4x1.6 GHz Tempest). The processor speed is high and efficient and makes the phone ideal for multitasking and even gaming. For the graphics, it comes with an upgraded Apple GPU (4-core graphics).</p><h3>Storage</h3><p class=align-left>The three different versions of iPhone Xs Max all have 4 GB RAM but the ROM size varies between 64 GB, 256 GB and 512 GB. They are all adequate for storing your media files.</p><p class=align-left>The device does not have an external storage allowance. iPhone Xs Max memory options provide sufficient storage capacity and depending on your storage needs, you can choose the most appropriate size of internal storage.</p><h3>Battery</h3><p class=align-left>The device has a non-removable Li-Ion 3174 mAh battery, 15W fast charging and Qi wireless charging. iPhone Xs Max battery capacity is quite durable, and it is among the best in iPhones, although the fast charging is a bit outdated and slow.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/db642c33db8903b6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Find out interesting details about the Huawei Nova 6</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It can support up to approximately 16 hours of talk time. The battery can power the phone for a considerable period, and that feature makes it suitable for gaming.</p><h3>Speaker and call quality</h3><p class=align-left>The gadget has two speakers; one at the notch, which also doubles as the earpiece and another at the bottom, usually considered the main speaker. The top speaker is almost as powerful as the bottom speaker, and that provides the best call quality.

It captures the essential requirements of users with its numerous features. It relies on a processor that is fast and suitable for gaming and multitasking. Its large display unit and high screen resolution make it a top priority for gamers and those who love watching videos. The lack of an external memory slot is a step-down if you need a higher storage capacity than that provided by the internal memory.</p><p class=align-left>While the iPhone Xs Max would give you an incredible user experience, the phone is costly, and its price might not be within the reach of a majority of people. If you are not limited to iPhones, you can opt for other brands such as the Huawei P20 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnOEkWprcGWZpbWwusRmr6xlnZbFbr%2FPnpqsZaCntqSxjKucr6GVrHqlsdOaoKWrXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f1282147-iphone-xs-max-specs-price-review-details-html.html&text=iPhone%20Xs%20Max%20specs%2c%20price%2c%20review%2c%20all%20details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1282147-iphone-xs-max-specs-price-review-details-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1282147-iphone-xs-max-specs-price-review-details-html.html&title=iPhone%20Xs%20Max%20specs%2c%20price%2c%20review%2c%20all%20details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f1282147-iphone-xs-max-specs-price-review-details-html.html&title=iPhone%20Xs%20Max%20specs%2c%20price%2c%20review%2c%20all%20details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f1282147-iphone-xs-max-specs-price-review-details-html.html&title=iPhone%20Xs%20Max%20specs%2c%20price%2c%20review%2c%20all%20details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1282147-iphone-xs-max-specs-price-review-details-html.html&description=iPhone%20Xs%20Max%20specs%2c%20price%2c%20review%2c%20all%20details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./276442-odm-party-official-accuses-dp-ruto-looting-bankroll-2022-campaigns-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ODM party official accuses DP Ruto of looting to bankroll 2022 campaigns">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sinister-pond-babe-tiktok.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Sinister Pond Babe on TikTok?
