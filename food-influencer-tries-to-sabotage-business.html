Foodie to write: "May your business never succeed And may you close down" you ask? Andrew explains in his video delineating the situation.</p><p>He said that the business in question, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">626 Hospitality</a>, which provides ice cream to other restaurants and has their own shop, posted about their interaction with a food blogger / Influencer who was interested in partnering up with them.</p><p>Andrew said that while the woman's message did seem a bit on the "impersonal" side for his tastes, as he, himself, would've probably been a little bit more detailed in reaching out to a food business to see if they wanted to collaborate, that there was ultimately nothing wrong with that first ping.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@andreweatsinsf href=#>@andreweatsinsf</a><p>PSA to all foodies: Be kind y‚Äôall and don‚Äôt wish ill intent on small businesses or leave negative reviews because they cant respond fast enough to collab.

The second time, there was a family emergency they had to tend to, which they explained to Tiff in a follow-up message.</p><p>Upon explaining the situation to Tiff and then declining her offer to collaborate, the L.A. Food Blogger basically told them to go and kick rocks and wished that their business would fail, even after hearing that they were in the midst of still "dealing" with a family emergency.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @andreweatsinsf</span></figure><p>"That's just cruel," he said, urging anyone else who is in the food blogging business to never behave the way that Tiff did in her conversation with 626 Hospitality. "It will come back to you. As a Google reviewer for 7 years you are never allowed to leave a review for a business you actually haven't been to as a customer," he adds.</p><p>The reason why Andrew brings that up is because it seems that Tiff went to 626 Hospitality's page to malign their business, echoing some of the same messaging she penned to them in her DMs, telling folks to never give them their money and stating that she doesn't want the place to succeed because they dared to decline her offer for collaboration.</p><p>Andrew went on to say that ethically she still shouldn't leave a review if she received any type of comped meal or payment for her services: "She still cannot leave a review for a business because if anything is comped, if she's paid, you know doesn't really matter either or, it's considered inauthentic for Google and Yelp, so for all the foodies out there, never leave a review."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @andreweatsinsf</span></figure><p>His video then transitions to a screenshot Yelp review that Tiff left on the business' page as well, which he says was summarily taken down, "Thank you Yelp community managers," he says into the camera.</p><p>In what looks like a reaction to being called out by the business on social media for her behavior, Andrew points out that Tiff has deactivated her social media accounts, except for her TikTok.</p><p>"All in all y'all, if you're a foodie, content creator, anywhere in the world please treat these small businesses with respect and with you know, flexibility. Because things can happen, it's happened to me a lot, where I message a restaurant, and actually don't get to come for another couple months because of like events, family stuff, whatever," he says towards the end of the video before showing off the type of products 626 Hospitality Group serves up to its customers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @andreweatsinsf</span></figure><p>Several TikTokers who responded to his video applauded 626 Hospitality for keeping its response to Tiff "classy" while others lambasted the food blogger for "toxic" behavior.</p><p>Others said that they knew the owners of 626 personally and said they were "the sweetest."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7ywsIyipZ%2BkpZq7pLHRZquroZWoerW7jKyYm6eklrSmecGuqqKmlajA</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffood-influencer-tries-to-sabotage-business.html&text=Food%20Influencer%20Tries%20to%20Sabotage%20Business%2c%20Gets%20Called%20Out&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffood-influencer-tries-to-sabotage-business.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffood-influencer-tries-to-sabotage-business.html&title=Food%20Influencer%20Tries%20to%20Sabotage%20Business%2c%20Gets%20Called%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffood-influencer-tries-to-sabotage-business.html&title=Food%20Influencer%20Tries%20to%20Sabotage%20Business%2c%20Gets%20Called%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffood-influencer-tries-to-sabotage-business.html&title=Food%20Influencer%20Tries%20to%20Sabotage%20Business%2c%20Gets%20Called%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffood-influencer-tries-to-sabotage-business.html&description=Food%20Influencer%20Tries%20to%20Sabotage%20Business%2c%20Gets%20Called%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./380499-jimmy-butler-bio-mom-stats-girlfriend-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jimmy Butler bio: Mom, stats, girlfriend, net worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./breaking-federal-govt-postpones-2020-waec-neco-indefinitely.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Federal Govt.
