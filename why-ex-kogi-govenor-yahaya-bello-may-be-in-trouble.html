These are some of the issues, which have riled some powerful elements and ex-governor Bello needs to be very careful with his actions.”</p><p>The aftermath of the last gubernatorial election in Kogi State has seemingly intensified internal discord within the All Progressives Congress (APC), with former Governor Yahaya Bello at the center of the controversy.</p><p>Despite Bello’s influence in ensuring the succession of his preferred candidate, the election has reportedly left the party with significant “collateral damage” and exacerbated tribal divisions within the state.</p><p>Vanguard’s investigation reveals that Bello’s maneuvering in the gubernatorial election has alienated several party leaders, some of whom openly supported the opposition candidate as a form of protest against Bello’s leadership style.</p><p>This act of defiance underscores the depth of dissatisfaction within the APC’s ranks and signals a reluctance among its members to see Bello continue as a significant influence within the party.</p><p>Amid these political tensions, Bello now also faces legal challenges. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has recently amended its charges to include the former governor in a case concerning the alleged laundering of N80 billion of Kogi State funds.</p><p>The timing and rationale behind Bello’s inclusion in the amended charges, especially considering the alleged offenses took place in 2015—before his tenure as governor—remain subjects of speculation.</p><p>Questions linger over whether Bello’s initial exclusion from the charges was due to the immunity he enjoyed as governor or if other factors were at play.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49xZrCgqWKyuXnKqJ6iZZekw6a6zqtkspmYlsaiecGeo6WnXaKuunnBnmSipl2pv7DBwaWcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-ex-kogi-govenor-yahaya-bello-may-be-in-trouble.html&text=%27Why%20Ex-Kogi%20Govenor%2c%20Yahaya%20Bello%20May%20Be%20In%20Trouble%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-ex-kogi-govenor-yahaya-bello-may-be-in-trouble.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-ex-kogi-govenor-yahaya-bello-may-be-in-trouble.html&title=%27Why%20Ex-Kogi%20Govenor%2c%20Yahaya%20Bello%20May%20Be%20In%20Trouble%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-ex-kogi-govenor-yahaya-bello-may-be-in-trouble.html&title=%27Why%20Ex-Kogi%20Govenor%2c%20Yahaya%20Bello%20May%20Be%20In%20Trouble%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-ex-kogi-govenor-yahaya-bello-may-be-in-trouble.html&title=%27Why%20Ex-Kogi%20Govenor%2c%20Yahaya%20Bello%20May%20Be%20In%20Trouble%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-ex-kogi-govenor-yahaya-bello-may-be-in-trouble.html&description=%27Why%20Ex-Kogi%20Govenor%2c%20Yahaya%20Bello%20May%20Be%20In%20Trouble%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-61st-street-filmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="61st Street Seeks to Show a Chicago Community in All Its Breadth and Depth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./omarion-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Omarion - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
