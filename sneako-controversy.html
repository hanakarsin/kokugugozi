Allegations of rape and sexual assault were lodged against Brand in September 2023, but he has plenty of supporters after cultivating a distrust in the media over the course of several years. He claims to peddle the truth, but perhaps not his own.</p><p>SNEAKO has spent most of his life creating content on YouTube. As a kid, he urged his young fans to listen and think critically, but all of that changed after a fallout between SNEAKO and his friend-turned-employer, MrBeast.</p><p>Since then, he has gained followers the old fashioned way, using hate. Recently he <a href=#>stepped into some controversy</a> after a few young fans excitedly echoed his own misogynistic and transphobic language upon meeting him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@sneako</a><p>SNEAKO with former president Donald Trump</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">The SNEAKO controversy is no laughing matter.</h2><p>For a moment, the world mistakenly thought SNEAKO saw the error of his ways when he encountered three young fans in the wild. The boys, who look to be about 10 or 11 years-old, excitedly asked SNEAKO for a selfie. He obliged and as he began taking pictures, one excitedly began scream, "F--- the women! F--- the women," to a seemingly shocked SNEAKO.</p><p>"No, no, no, wait, we love women," he says to the misogynists-in-training. The kids then countered with, "But not like, 'transgenders.'" Based on everything SNEAKO has said publicly, he should have been thrilled by this horrifying follow in his bigoted footsteps. However, he tried to steer the kids in a different direction.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@.clipzzz__ href=#>@.clipzzz__</a><p>ðŸ˜­ <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=sneako href=#>#sneako</a> <a title=sneakoclips href=#>#sneakoclips</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - CLIPZZ" href=#>â™¬ original sound - CLIPZZ</a></figure><p>SNEAKO attempted to tell the children that "we love everyone," but things took an even darker turn. "All gays should die," screamed one of the deeply misled youth. With a haunted look on his face, SNEAKO turned to the phone that recorded the entire exchange and asked, "What have I done?" This could be a canon moment for the man who once preached self-reflection but alas, he doubled down on his vitriol.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">SNEAKO released an apology video with a twist.</h2><p>On Sept. 19, 2023, SNEAKO <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted out a video response</a> to the viral TikTok where he appears to very nearly regret his actions. He begins by saying the "liberals were right" and that "YouTube was right to ban him." Honestly, he went in too hard up top. It's clear he was not being serious. He goes on to say that he just didn't see the impact he was making on the young people who followed him.</p><p>When SNEAKO alluded to the insane <a href=#>Colleen Ballinger</a> apology video, by wishing he had a ukulele, it was clear he learned nothing. Fake crying is followed by the mask slowly slipping off. "I think we can deeply apologize for being the most racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist, not giving a f---, 'schizo' stream on the internet."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>im sorry. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/22vgT70zDs</a></p>â€” SNEAKO (@sneako) <a href=#>September 20, 2023</a></figure><p>He then pulls out a variation of locker room talk, but swaps out the locker room for Call of Duty. According to SNEAKO, this is how middle schoolers talk. Specifically, this is how they speak to each other while playing games like Call of Duty. Even though the kids very clearly ran up to SNEAKO in order to shout things to him that they heard from him, he is not responsible for their hate speech. It's video games.</p><p>SNEAKO then says that he loves everyone and has never said he hates a group of people. This is after he told a story about being 12 years-old and seeing two men kiss in a grocery store, which caused him to point at them while yelling GROSS. He believes kids just inherently know that's wrong.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parenting Science</a>, babies are born with the ability to recognize a parent's voice, certain melodies, some language, and a "rudimentary sense of number or quantity." We didn't see anything about believing gay people are gross, but maybe that study hasn't been conducted yet.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is a member of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning community and need support, the </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LGBT National Help Center</strong></a><strong> provides free and confidential resources.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLumrcqoZJynnqm%2FsMLEq6qy</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsneako-controversy.html&text=SNEAKO%20Tweeted%20out%20a%20Fake%20Apology%20in%20Response%20to%20Controversy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsneako-controversy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsneako-controversy.html&title=SNEAKO%20Tweeted%20out%20a%20Fake%20Apology%20in%20Response%20to%20Controversy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsneako-controversy.html&title=SNEAKO%20Tweeted%20out%20a%20Fake%20Apology%20in%20Response%20to%20Controversy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsneako-controversy.html&title=SNEAKO%20Tweeted%20out%20a%20Fake%20Apology%20in%20Response%20to%20Controversy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsneako-controversy.html&description=SNEAKO%20Tweeted%20out%20a%20Fake%20Apology%20in%20Response%20to%20Controversy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tannerites-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tannerites - Members, Ages, Trivia">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./291924-mawazo-6-unayofaa-kuepuka-wakati-unapotafuta-penzi-la-kudumu-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mawazo 6 unayofaa kuepuka wakati unapotafuta penzi la kudumu">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
