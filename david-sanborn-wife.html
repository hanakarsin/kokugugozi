The alto saxophonist had been playing the instrument since before high school and he used that experience to propel himself through the music industry. Recognized as one of the most commercially successful American saxophonists in the business, his music helped influence generations of R&B, jazz, and pop. Despite having been active since 1959, he reportedly had concert dates lined up into 2025.</p><p>Clearly, David was ready to play music for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, his time came a little earlier than most would have expected. It was announced that David died on May 12, 2024. The jazz musician's death is mourned by several fans and celebrities, including <a href=#>Mark Hamill</a>. He leaves behind an enormous legacy comprised of several accomplishments in the world of jazz. He is also survived by his wife and son. Here's what we know about his family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">David Sanborn was married to another musician named Alice Soyer.</h2><p>David had been married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice Soyer</a>, a fellow musician with whom he performed several times in the past.</p><p>Alice is a composer, pianist, and vocalist who was born and raised in Paris, France.

Not unlike a scene straight out of a romance film, they met each other after she heard David practicing saxophone through a window.</p><p>"I didn't see him right away, but I heard him," she told the outlet. "Then we spoke at dinner. It was so great and so natural. He was very encouraging. Told me to keep on writing, that it is great."</p><p>They officially started dating in 2016 and were married by 2020, spending the COVID-19 quarantine together.</p><p>As of this writing, Alice has made no public statements on the death of her husband on social media.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It is with sad and heavy hearts that we convey to you the loss of internationally renowned, 6 time Grammy Award-winning, saxophonist, David Sanborn.
