The clip then transitions to one-half of the married couple dancing in the middle of the wedding venue with a man, which another caption for the video reveals is her brother: "In lieu of the father-daughter dance, her brothers stepped in for sibling dance"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cynandtessa href=#>@cynandtessa</a><p>When my father-in-law decided not to attend our wedding, our siblings stepped up ðŸ’œ <a title=cuÃ±ados href=#>#cuÃ±ados</a> <a title=lesbianwedding href=#>#lesbianwedding</a> <a title=queerwedding href=#>#queerwedding</a> <a title=wlw href=#>#wlw</a> <a title=mexicanwedding href=#>#mexicanwedding</a></p><a title="â™¬ Vals PoÃ©tico (feat.

A caption for the video reads: "When my father-in-law decided not to attend our wedding, our siblings stepped up"</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford Academic</a>, same-sex couples may be at risk for added stress, which could bring about additional challenges in their personal lives and romantic relationship, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gottman Institute</a> writes that stresses can be compounded even more when family members are unsupportive.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cynandtessa</span></figure><p>The topic of "toxic" and/or unsupportive family members when it comes to relationships has been thoroughly discussed by various outlets. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marriage 365</a> penned a piece discussing these effects and how they could play a part in the dissolution of a relationship.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthline</a> writes how toxic family members or environments can negatively impact anyone's attempts at progressing in pretty much any avenue of life, while also sharing helpful tips on the best ways to navigate these relationships: "If you suspect youâ€™re currently dealing with family toxicity, start by thinking about the way you feel after interacting with certain family members."</p><p>Katherine Fabrizio (MA, LPC) is quoted as saying in the article that if you ultimately end up feeling bad after an interaction with a particular family member then there is most likely a reason for that: "If you end up feeling bad about yourself after most encounters with a family member, thereâ€™s probably a good reason for that, one worth looking into."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cynandtessa</span></figure><p>Another key indicator that a family member might be toxic, according to the outlet: "family members might try to control major aspects of your life, including your relationships and career decisions. They might imply (or say outright) that aligning with their expectations is a condition of their continued love and support."</p><p>It can be argued that one of Cyn & Tessa's parents wasn't supportive of their same-sex marriage could be perceived as a means of a parent attempting to control one aspect of their life â€” not giving their blessing, shows that they value their religious convictions more than their daughter's decision to fulfill herself in a way that she sees fit.</p><p>Which seems to tie into another point that Healthline points to as a possible sign one's family member might be toxic: "Itâ€™s normal for family members to have occasional disagreements. But at the end of the day, you should still treat each other with love and kindness."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cynandtessa</span></figure><p>The outlet went on to discuss this possibility further, writing: " In a toxic family dynamic, you might feel contempt or disdain instead of love. A toxic family member might: mock or belittle your choices attack your vulnerable points chip away at your self-esteem"</p><p>Judging by the videos Cyn & Tessa posted about their relationship, it seems that even though one of their parents isn't giving their blessing for their union, that they have an outpouring of support, and love for each other.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @cynandtessa</span></figure><p>Numerous commenters who responded to their clip also shared how difficult it is for them to not receive unanimous support from their loved ones for their own relationships.</p><p>If you or someone you care about is being discriminated against due to their sexual orientation, you can seek help resourced at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LGBT Hotline here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqsMSsZJ%2BZpJ2ys3nWqKWtZZGpwaa6w2ajoJqkpnq4scOdoKef</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrides-father-wont-attend-lgbtq-wedding.html&text=Brides%20Father%20Wont%20Attend%20LGBTQ%20Wedding%2c%20Brothers%20Step%20Up&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrides-father-wont-attend-lgbtq-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrides-father-wont-attend-lgbtq-wedding.html&title=Brides%20Father%20Wont%20Attend%20LGBTQ%20Wedding%2c%20Brothers%20Step%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrides-father-wont-attend-lgbtq-wedding.html&title=Brides%20Father%20Wont%20Attend%20LGBTQ%20Wedding%2c%20Brothers%20Step%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrides-father-wont-attend-lgbtq-wedding.html&title=Brides%20Father%20Wont%20Attend%20LGBTQ%20Wedding%2c%20Brothers%20Step%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrides-father-wont-attend-lgbtq-wedding.html&description=Brides%20Father%20Wont%20Attend%20LGBTQ%20Wedding%2c%20Brothers%20Step%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeffree-star-trisha-paytas-drama-hair-by-jay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Did Hair by Jay and Jeffree Star Say About Trisha Paytas?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./20-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
