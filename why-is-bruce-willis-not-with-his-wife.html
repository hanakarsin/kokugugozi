But the unique living situation is causing controversy among some fans who believe Bruce should be social distancing with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his second wife</a>, Emma Heming Willis, and their two young girls.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why is Bruce Willis not with his wife?</h2><p>Neither Emma nor Demi (Bruce is not on social media) have addressed comments surrounding the family’s quarantine, but it’s possible that the father of five is switching between homes in an effort to spend time with all of his daughters during the outbreak.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Though unconfirmed, it’s believed that Bruce spent his 65th birthday on March 19 with Emma and their kids, Mabel, 8, and Evelyn, 5. He was first pictured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hanging out with Demi</a> and their brood on April 7, which the actress referred to as "Family bonding."</p><p>Below the photo, which showed the Willis-Moore clan (plus a few significant others) wearing matching pajamas, Emma wrote, "At its finest. love and miss you guys," letting followers know that she’s totally OK with the current arrangement.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, some commenters remain convinced that there’s more to the story. One user remarked, "I think [the choice of quarantine is] deliberate to stir up interest," while another added, "When it’s the end of the world sometimes ya gotta pick a family."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bruce Willis and Demi Moore have long been Hollywood’s friendliest exes.</h2><p>Ever since their separation in 1998, the pair has been committed co-parents and supportive of each other’s subsequent relationships. When Demi released her candid memoir, "Inside Out," in September, her former spouse was nothing but encouraging.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I was getting ready to do Jimmy Fallon live the other night, and I was in the dressing room and my phone rang, and it was Bruce," the 57-year-old recalled on an October episode of the podcast "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Present Company with Krista Smith</a>."</p><p>"I was prepared for there, maybe, to be some sensitivities, and he called and he got very emotional. He said, 'I'm so proud of you,'" Demi revealed. "I, too, then became very emotional, and I’m not a crier... the purity of his love and acceptance... it just really meant so much, so much to me."</p><p>Shortly after the duo’s divorce was finalized, Bruce expressed his admiration for Demi in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, which foreshadowed their impressive post-breakup friendship. "I still love Demi. We’re very close," the Die Hard alum said at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have three children whom we will continue to raise together, and we’re probably as close now as we ever were. We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids."</p><p>The actors’ eldest daughter, Rumer, praised her parents’ teamwork in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 interview</a>. "I never had to split up vacations or split up birthdays," she shared. "They always made an effort to do all of the family events still together and made such an effort to still have our family be as one unit, as opposed to two separate things."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJuqpZiybsPIpaOiq12jvLV51qKroWWYnsBuw8ifnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-bruce-willis-not-with-his-wife.html&text=Why%20Is%20Bruce%20Willis%20Not%20With%20His%20Wife%20in%20Quarantine%3f%20It%27s%20All%20Very%20Confusing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-bruce-willis-not-with-his-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-bruce-willis-not-with-his-wife.html&title=Why%20Is%20Bruce%20Willis%20Not%20With%20His%20Wife%20in%20Quarantine%3f%20It%27s%20All%20Very%20Confusing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-is-bruce-willis-not-with-his-wife.html&title=Why%20Is%20Bruce%20Willis%20Not%20With%20His%20Wife%20in%20Quarantine%3f%20It%27s%20All%20Very%20Confusing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-bruce-willis-not-with-his-wife.html&title=Why%20Is%20Bruce%20Willis%20Not%20With%20His%20Wife%20in%20Quarantine%3f%20It%27s%20All%20Very%20Confusing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-bruce-willis-not-with-his-wife.html&description=Why%20Is%20Bruce%20Willis%20Not%20With%20His%20Wife%20in%20Quarantine%3f%20It%27s%20All%20Very%20Confusing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-buharis-minister-tinubu-appointed-as-sgf.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Buhari's Minister Tinubu Appointed As SGF">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./patrick-swayze-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrick Swayze - Trivia, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
