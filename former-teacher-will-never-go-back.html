"It's a problem," she said.</p><p>As such, she emailed the student's parent and explained what happened.

She also noted that to be fair to the rest of the class, she would not be letting that student pick again from the bucket for the rest of the semester.</p><p>The student's mother was not apologetic whatsoever. She replied to Bethany: ‚ÄúMaybe you shouldn‚Äôt leave a bucket of fun things out and entice an 8-year-old boy.‚Äù She also did not agree with the fact that Bethany was temporarily nixing her son's privilege of picking from the bucket.</p><p>When Bethany explained the situation to the administration, she was offered no support and was told to "let it go."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>In the comment section, users were appalled by how the student's mother and administration had responded to the incident. "OMG, as a mom, I would have made him bring it back plus gone to the store and restocked it," wrote one person.</p><p>Another comment read: "Only taught a year because I saw the administration for what it was when they forced me to pass a failed student."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Other former teachers divulged some of the wild things that went on in their classrooms.</p><p>"I taught 8th grade and a boy took a bottle of vinegar during a science demo and poured it into my purse, destroying my phone," said one person.</p><p>A second wrote: "I have Disney dolls in my classroom and they're only out when the kids are playing.
