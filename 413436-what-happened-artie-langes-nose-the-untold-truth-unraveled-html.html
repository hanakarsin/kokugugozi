However, Artie has been battling drug abuse for three decades, which has affected his facial appearance. Notably, his nose has an unusually flat and swollen shape, which was not the case before. What happened to Artie Lange’s nose and how is he fairing today?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/c1b144e0eba68d92.jpeg><p class=align-left>As a hard-drug abuser, Artie Lange’s nose' septum became severely damaged. Although he has been using several medications, Artie is yet to undergo corrective surgery for his deformed nose.</p><p class=align-left>So how did he land this fate? Did his nose arise from a congenital disability or an infliction? Here is everything you need to know about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Artie Lange's nose</a>.</p><h2>What happened to Artie Lange’s nose?</h2><p class=align-left>The tale behind Artie Lange’s nose collapse is a sad and scary result of what heroin could do to your health. Known to have battled <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">drug addiction</a> for more than 30 years, Artie's health has been at stake severally. The 53-year-old's struggle has been so intense, causing him severe deformity to his nose.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a67711b6a19526fd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Power Celebrates Auto Electrician Mechanic Zipporah Mulati, Who Gave Birth to All Her Kids via C-Section</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Medical experts confirm that snorting hard drugs could lead to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">collapse</a> of the septum. This is the organ at the middle of the nose comprising a bone and cartilage that separates the nostrils. Therefore, there's a high likelihood that Artie's septum is completely damaged from the looks of his flat swollen nose.</p><p class=align-left>What happened to Artie Lange’s nose is not the only health hitch the comedian encountered. Things got worse for Artie when he collapsed on stage while doing a live performance. He had emergency heart surgery that saved his life.</p><h2>Artie Lange’s nose before drugs</h2><p class=align-left>In his early days of doing comedy, Artie Lange’s face was pretty normal. He had always put on a bubbly face with all his facial structures intact. However, things started changing in 2017 when his nose started losing its normal shape. Unfortunately, the change was not short-term, and it appeared as if the damage in Artie’s nose was deteriorating by the day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7d408cdf089310d8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?

Artie is the perfect case study. The addiction can be intense, resulting in more health repercussions. For example, Artie Lange snorted glass at some point, and he even admitted that he had mistaken it for OxyCont*n. This further aggravated his septum, thus leading to more injury and damage.</p><h2>Artie Lange’s addiction has landed him some legal consequences</h2><p class=align-left>His addiction to heroin, cocaine, opium and other hard drugs have had severe consequences on his life. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to owning heroin. Lange was thereafter put under strict probation for four years. Several celebrities even went to his social media handles, urging him to ditch the drugs. But instead, he promised to change and even admitted that he needed help.</p><p class=align-left>After rehabilitation and Artie being sober for seven months straight, the 53-year-old comedian’s photos resurfaced in 2019. Artie Lange appeared happier, content, and even thinner. On 10th September 2019, he tweeted:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b17b7ffda4f24ca1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Koffi Olomide: 9 Radiant Photos of Stylish Singer Defying Age With His Sense of Fashion</span></p></a>Great to be home! 7 months, 14 days sober but one day at a time. Lots of new stories to tell. Will announce some new tour dates on Friday. Thanks for the support. Love you all.<h2>Will Artie Lange undergo plastic surgery?</h2><p class=align-left>Artie is not getting plastic surgery on his nose. Instead, he has accepted his fate and admits that it is a constant reminder of what drugs could do to your health. He reiterated:</p><i>This nose should be a reminder for young people, that even if you make money and have success, you can still live like a straight-up scumbag,”</i> Artie warned.<i> “I never was a bad person, but I did a lot of bad things because I was addicted to drugs.</i><p class=align-left>Artie even jokes about his nose now and again on his social media pages. As a result, some of his fans have gotten accustomed to seeing him with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deformed nose</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6fd3d7db8e4c2d97.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Woman Forced To Painfully Inform 6-Year-Old Son She Has Stage 3 Cancer, Will Soon Die</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Artie Lange has been offered corrective surgery by top surgeons. Dr. Nassif, a renowned plastic surgeon and star of the reality TV show&nbsp;Botched offered to fix Artie’s nose. Nassif was concerned about what happened to Artie’s nose.</p><p class=align-left>He even examined the X-ray pictures and assured Lange that he could get ‘fixed’. However, the comedian’s response to Dr. Nassif seemed hesitant. Although he mentioned that he might eventually get corrective surgery, Artie claimed that the status of his nose has improved.</p><p class=align-left>What happened to Artie Lange’s nose is a lesson of the adverse effects of doing drugs. Lange has now shifted gears. The legendary comedian has been clean for the past two years. He serves as an inspiration and attributes his wins to his fans that supported him throughout his fight with drug addiction.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published an article about <a href=#>Amanda Perez</a>.
