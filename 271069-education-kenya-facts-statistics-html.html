In terms of education, our country competes equally with the others. Kenya’s education system is a mixture of religious, social-cultural, artistic, and traditional aspects of life. Coming to the history of education in Kenya before independence; the first western education in Kenya was introduced by the missionaries. They were the Portuguese Roman Catholics. Monasteries were founded in Mombasa and Lamu by the missionaries. With British ruling Kenya, more Christian missionaries were sent by the CMS, who were mainly the Lutherans. The main motive of the missionaries was to convert the Africans to Christianity. The missionary’s main motive was to teach the Africans to lead a normal and healthy life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8a7a43bd8573d29.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Potterhouse School contacts, fees structure and curriculum</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Best secondary schools in Kenya</strong></p><h2>New Education System in Kenya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8a7a43bd8573d29.jpeg><p class=align-left>Earlier, Kenya used to follow the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">8-4-4 education system</a>, which comprised of 8 years of primary education, followed by 4 years of secondary and4 years of university education. This procedure was followed since the year 1895. However, this system was heavily criticized for adding up an extra amount of pressure on the students. This necessitated the introduction of a new education system in Kenya which was first tested in May 2017. The new education curriculum was proposed so that every Kenyan gets to learn the basics of moral and ethical values which will make them a good citizen and also employable.</p><p class=align-left>After all the protest and urge to bring a new structure, the <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">2-6-6-3 education system</a> in Kenya was introduced. The new system was different than the previous one, where there will be 2 years of pre-primary education, 6 years of primary education, 3 years of junior secondary school, 3 years of senior secondary school and 3 years for higher education.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/684631a6952338c0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>International School of Kenya fees, scholarships, contacts</span></p></a><h2>Ministry Of Education in Kenya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs1v0ralggnvd8.jpeg><p class=align-left>The main goal of the ministry of education is to provide the best quality of education, research, and training.
