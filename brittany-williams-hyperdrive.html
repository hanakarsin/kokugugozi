Keep reading for everything you need to know about the racer, including whether she wins the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittany Williams has only been drifting for two and a half years.</h2><p>The 27-year-old blonde Lewisville, Tex. native is the first female competitor we meet on Hyperdrive. "I'm still learning every time I get behind the wheel," she says upon introduction.</p><p>Unlike most of her other competitors, Brittany has only been racing for two and a half years. "I'm still actually pretty novice compared to some of the other drivers out there," she admits. "But what I've noticed is that if I focus on just enjoying myself, I do better."</p><p>Commentators agree "this lady is a natural" despite her comparative lack of experience. "It's the lessons she learned during her difficult childhood that fuel her on the track," one of them adds, before Brittany reveals that she spent a period of time growing up homeless.</p><p>"Growing up as a kid," she says, "there was a point where we were homeless, but my mom was able to make sure that we were always positive despite going through that level of hardship." It's that motivation that keeps her going on the race tracks. "My goal is always to have as much fun as possible in everything that I'm doing," she says, "and honestly, that's kind of a win-win."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittany's 2008 custom Nissan was one of her "biggest worries going into the series."</h2><p>Hyperdrive is the "ultimate test of man, woman, and machine," as the series' host describes it. And as far as the rules of the game go, each competitor shows up to the track with their own custom-built machine with the goal of getting through a series of challenging obstacles faster than the others.</p><p>Brittany's ride is a 2008 Nissan 350Z with 270 horsepower, which we quickly learn is nowhere near "as much power as the other cars" in the game. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, Brittany admitted that she was worried about her car and how it would compare with those of the other 27 drivers.</p><p>"My car is pretty slow compared to most competition-based cars," she said. "That was one of my biggest worries going into the series. I wasn't sure that power was going to be a really big issue for me." While commentators are skeptical when they see Brittany's car, an obstacle where drivers must race through water quickly highlights the Nissan 350Z's benefits.</p><p>"That's the advantage of having a street car instead of having a true race car," they say when they see Brittany fly through the water. "This is a converted street car so her engine is prepared for the elements," they add.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Brittany Williams win Hyperdrive? (SPOILERS!)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Brittany does not win Hyperdrive, though she does make it to the top eight racers who advance to the third Knockout Round, thanks to her spotter and husband Kevin Williams, who helps her navigate the course. Off the show, the married couple has almost 100,000 followers on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adventure-focused YouTube page</a>.</p><p>Brittany is eliminated in Episode 8 but has no regrets about appearing on the show. In fact, she has a newfound respect for executive producer Charlize Theron, who got "into the cars with some of the competitors," she told USA Today. "It was really cool seeing her... because some of these cars she got into were maybe not even vehicles I would get into," she said.</p><p>Stream Hyperdrive on Netflix today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqwNOapbJlp565rbXApqpmoKmlsrOw0aKtng%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrittany-williams-hyperdrive.html&text=Brittany%20Williams%20Is%20One%20of%20the%20Baddest%20Drifters%20on%20%27Hyperdrive%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrittany-williams-hyperdrive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrittany-williams-hyperdrive.html&title=Brittany%20Williams%20Is%20One%20of%20the%20Baddest%20Drifters%20on%20%27Hyperdrive%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrittany-williams-hyperdrive.html&title=Brittany%20Williams%20Is%20One%20of%20the%20Baddest%20Drifters%20on%20%27Hyperdrive%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrittany-williams-hyperdrive.html&title=Brittany%20Williams%20Is%20One%20of%20the%20Baddest%20Drifters%20on%20%27Hyperdrive%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrittany-williams-hyperdrive.html&description=Brittany%20Williams%20Is%20One%20of%20the%20Baddest%20Drifters%20on%20%27Hyperdrive%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-jenny-undisputed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Don't Panic: Jenny Taft Will Be Back on Fox Sports 1's 'Undisputed'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./420015-akothees-thirdborn-daughter-fancy-makadia-threatens-expose-thirsty-men-dming-her-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Akothee's Thirdborn Daughter Fancy Makadia Threatens to Expose Thirsty Men DMing Her">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
