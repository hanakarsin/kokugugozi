style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today, Monday, 3rd October 2022</h2><p>President Muhammadu Buhari is set to confer National Honours Awards to people with disability, a gateman, a cleaner, a bank security guard and some foreigners.</p><p>Among those favoured for the award are Josephine Agu, an airport cleaner who returned $12,200 found in a toilet at MMIA, Lagos and Ogbanago Muhammed Ibrahim, a bank security man who found and returned $10,000.</p><p>Naija News reports that the awardees who are part of the list of 437 nominees for the National Honours Awards 2022 have contributed to the development of the country in various capacities.</p><p>The investiture is scheduled to hold on the 11th of October, 2022 at the State House in Abuja.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former vice President Atiku Abubakar, has been lambasted for pledging to cede the presidency to the zone in 2027.</p><p>Naija News reports that Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and other prominent leaders from Southeast have advised Nigerians not to take his words seriously.</p><p>Ohanaeze said no person from Southeast or Igbo would take the advice of the former vice-president serious.</p><p>The Southeast leaders were reacting to Atiku’s statement during a rally in Enugu where he was quoted to have said that he would support Ndigbo to win the Presidency in 2027 in return for the region’s votes for him in 2023.</p><p>The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested an ex-footballer for importing cocaine into Nigeria.</p><p>This was made known on Sunday in a statement by the spokesperson of the NDLEA, Femi Babafemi.</p><p>The NDLEA statement later confirmed the name of the ex-footballer busted at the Lagos international airport as Okafor Emmanuel Junior.</p><p>The cocaine put at 1.40kg was carefully concealed in metal as revealed in the video shared by the NDLEA official.</p><p>The NDLEA stated further that the arrested ex-footballer is a 33-year-old indigene of Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State.</p><p>He was arrested on Monday, 26th September, 2022</p><p>There are fears that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu may be disqualified from participating in the 2023 elections.</p><p>Not only Tinubu, but it is also understood that other candidates of the party including the Ekiti State Governor-elect, Abiodun Oyebanji may be affected.</p><p>The fear stems from the Friday ruling by Justice Emeka Nwite of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja which nullified the nomination of Governor Isiaka Oyetola and his running mate, Benedict Alabi, as APC candidates for the 2022 Osun State governorship election.</p><p>Naija News recalls their candidature was nullified on the ground that Governor Mai Mala Buni who submitted their names to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) violated the provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Section 82(3) of the Electoral Act 2022.</p><p>Based on this, some political observers are of the opinion that all actions of Buni while in office as the APC caretaker National Chairman may be invalidated.</p><p>But the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Barrister Felix Morka ruled out any such happening, stating that the judgement of the high court does not hold water.</p><p>He told Sunday Tribune that the party is very confident the Court of Appeal will set aside the ruling of the lower court on the matter.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP), Malik Ado-Ibrahim has been summoned by the party over plans for the 2023 election.</p><p>According to the party, members are not satisfied with the preparations in place by the presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections.</p><p>A statement on Sunday by the YPP National Secretary, Egbeola Wale-Martins said the decision to summon Ado-Ibrahim was taken after the party’s 20th national working committee (NWC) meeting in Abuja.</p><p>He added that the gap in communication between the presidential candidate, the party leadership and its organs seem to have slowed down preparations for next year’s elections and hampered the expected fortunes of the YPP.</p><p>The National Secretary also stated that the outcome of the briefing from the presidential candidate would determine the next line of action to be taken by the party.</p><p>There was an angry moment of argument between the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige and the President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke during a negotiation meeting facilitated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.</p><p>Naija News reports that all stakeholders were properly represented at the meeting summoned as part of efforts to find a solution to the lingering ASUU strike which has kept the students of Nigeria’s public universities at home since February 14.</p><p>The various stakeholders including the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha made various submissions on how to resolve the lingering crisis.</p><p>However, in the course of the meeting, Ngige accused the ASUU president of saying the All Progressives Congress (APC) government had kept children at home and that the Nigerian people should vote them out.</p><p>The accusation by the Minister was however refuted by the ASUU camp and some others at the meeting.</p><p>The accusation also infuriated the ASUU leadership and led to a rowdy session in which Ngige was called a liar who is fond of misinforming the public by Prof. Osodeke.</p><p>The Minister however walked out of the meeting even as both of them continued exchanging heated words.</p><p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has appointed Governor Aminu Masari of Kastina State as Campaign Senior Adviser on Administration and Government.</p><p>Naija News reports that Tinubu, a former two-term Lagos State governor, also appointed the former governor of Sokoto State, Aliyu Wamakko, as Senior Adviser for Special Duties.</p><p>The appointment of the duo was made known in a letter on Sunday signed by the APC presidential candidate.</p><p>According to Tinubu, Masari and Wamakko’s impressive political achievements and exemplary leadership in their states and party members qualified them for the responsibility.</p><p>The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)’s counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, has said that the leader of the group, Nnamdi Kanu, did not order Southeasterners to sit at home on the 4th day of October, 2022</p><p>IPOB stated this via a statement issued and made available to newsmen.</p><p>Ejiofor urged members of the public to go about their normal activities and ignore the said directive.</p><p>Ejiofor went on to dismiss speculations that Kanu will appear at Federal High Court Umuahia, Abia State, next Tuesday when a fundamental rights enforcement suit filed on his behalf is scheduled to be held.</p><p>This is as the group stated that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar was not capable of stopping the IPOB movement.</p><p>This declaration is in response to a statement credited to Atiku claiming he would stop Biafra’s agitation if he becomes Nigerian President.</p><p>The group warned the Waziri against mentioning its name in any campaign in the Southeast.</p><p>The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christain Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Sunday prayed for Nigeria as the country marked its 62nd Independence.</p><p>Delivering a sermon at the national headquarters of the church, the renowned clergy said the country is at war, hence Nigerians should not deceive themselves.</p><p>Adeboye who spoke on the topic ‘PEACE IN THE LAND’, asked the congregation, Christians all over the country to pray for Nigerian leaders, those in public offices and traditional rulers.</p><p>Speaking on the challenges faced in Nigeria, Adeboye noted that as many times the country’s power generating set (The National Grid) has collapsed, there was always light in the Aso Rock Villa.</p><p>The gospel preacher went on to lament the growing insecurity in Nigeria, recalling how a state governor narrowly escape assassination by bandit terrorists.</p><p>Five Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors on Sunday met in Enugu State over the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>According to a report, the Governors held the closed-door meeting to deliberate on the presidential ambition of the Labour Party, flagbearer, Peter Obi.</p><p>The Governors in the meeting include Nyesom Wike (Rivers State), Samuel Ortom (Benue State), Seyi Makinde (Oyo State), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia State) and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu State).</p><p>A source that spoke with Daily Post on the meeting said the PDP Governors are aiming at supporting Obi because they are not pleased with the presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>The meeting is coming days after Atiku met with Governor Wike in Abuja to seek his support ahead of the 2023 presidential election.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
