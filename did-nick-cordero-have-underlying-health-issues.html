What this man has gone through! Nick is 41 years old. He had no pre-existing health conditions. We do not know how he got COVID-19 but he did. He went to the ER on March 30th and intubated on a ventilator on April 1. Since then has he has suffered an infection that caused his heart to stop, he needed resuscitation, he had two mini strokes, went on ECMO, went on dialysis, needed surgery to removal an ECMO cannula that was restricting blood flow to his leg, a faciatomy to relieve pressure on the leg, an amputation of his right leg, an MRI to further investigate brain damage, several bronchial sweeps to clear out his lungs, a septis infection causing septic shock, a fungus in his lungs, holes in his lungs, a tracheostomy, blood clots, low blood count and platelet levels, and a temporary pacemaker to assist his heart. He has spent 38 days now in the ICU. This disease does not only effect old people. This is real. A perfectly healthy 41 year old man! Bring awareness to his story. STAY HOME! FOLLOW GUIDELINES! This journey with Nick has been the hardest thing we’ve ever had to go through. I ask God for a miracle and my Dad reminded me that God is answering my prayer everyday because he is still with us! Nick is a fighter and has not given up. His doctors and nurses have been truly incredible.

These facts are why she was so public about the numerous complications he suffered since being admitted to the hospital.</p><p>"I never thought Nick or I would get COVID and we both thought [if] we did we would be able to stay at home and recover," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on June 15</a>. "Nick is 41 years old, in shape and had no preexisting health conditions.

As he emerged from a coma in mid-May, the Waitress star showed positive signs that he escaped severe brain damage.&nbsp;Unfortunately, other health issues persisted.</p><p>A persistent lung infection and prolonged reliance on a ventilator caused many complications. Nick had minor blood infections last month according to his widow, who says the infections caused problems with blood pressure. She maintained hope for a recovery until the end.</p><p>Nobody knows for sure why some otherwise healthy people react so severely to this virus. Researchers have only known of this novel coronavirus since late 2019, so studies of its effects on different populations are still ongoing. However, there are some theories.&nbsp;</p><p>One avenue of research may involve sequencing the genomes of young patients who did not have underlying health conditions to determine whether they have genetic markers in common that may have led to their severe reactions. Another theory is that for some young patients, the severity of the reaction could be due not to a suppressed immune system but a hyper-reactive one.</p><p>The phenomenon is called a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"cytokine storm"</a> because it is caused when the cytokine proteins that are part of the immune system cause an overreaction to an unfamiliar pathogen, such as a virus. But in its fight to suppress the foreign invader, the immune system also attacks the lungs, which might lead to the severe damage doctors have been seeing on scans, as well as the acute respiratory distress, clotting, and other issues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalec2imqRlk6S%2FpbHRqGShmaaaera6w56ppbGZo7RutMSao62gXZ7AtMHErA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-nick-cordero-have-underlying-health-issues.html&text=Did%20Nick%20Cordero%20Have%20Underlying%20Health%20Conditions%20Before%20COVID-19%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-nick-cordero-have-underlying-health-issues.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-nick-cordero-have-underlying-health-issues.html&title=Did%20Nick%20Cordero%20Have%20Underlying%20Health%20Conditions%20Before%20COVID-19%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-nick-cordero-have-underlying-health-issues.html&title=Did%20Nick%20Cordero%20Have%20Underlying%20Health%20Conditions%20Before%20COVID-19%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-nick-cordero-have-underlying-health-issues.html&title=Did%20Nick%20Cordero%20Have%20Underlying%20Health%20Conditions%20Before%20COVID-19%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-nick-cordero-have-underlying-health-issues.html&description=Did%20Nick%20Cordero%20Have%20Underlying%20Health%20Conditions%20Before%20COVID-19%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./seth-rogen-weight-loss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Weight Did the Star Lose?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./coza-pastor-biodun-fatoyinbo-reportedly-survives-stroke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="COZA Pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo Reportedly Survives Stroke">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
