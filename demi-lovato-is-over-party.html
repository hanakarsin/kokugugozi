But you know how the world of Twitter outrage works, at the end of the day.</p><p>For the most part, people latch on to something they're pretending to be furious about for a few hours, get said topic trending, then once that fizzles out, they jump onto the next issue to be upset about. The satisfaction seems to come from tweeting about how upset you are, rather than, you know, actually doing anything about it in real life, for the most part.</p><p>In this latest installment of "Demi Lovato is Over," folks were up in arms over her finsta (fake Instagram.)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The whole story is very, very strange. Namely because Demi has a fake Instagram with only 125 followers that apparently leaked her acts of pettiness against Selena (crossing her face out on a magazine cover they once shared, posting screenshots of her tracks surpassing Selena's on iTunes.)</p><p>Probably the most bizarre part of this story is the bit of the collage where Demi commented on a photo of Selena resting her head on her shoulder during an awards show.</p><p>The entire thing feels like that weird and pathetic social media flex, like when that Desi dude announced to all of social media that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salman had become his best friend</a> and Mudasir is no longer his pal amongst pals.</p><p>Demi's 27 years old and she's acting out like she's a freshman in high school; the whole thing's just embarrassing. It's difficult for her to even pretend like that account isn't hers, either, because, well, just look.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SIS CANNOT TRY TO SAY ITS NOT HER LMFAOO EXPOSED <a href=#>#DemiLovatoIsOverParty</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pYQH0efxya</a></p>— Maria (@selenarules6) <a href=#>April 17, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The whole finsta business has prompted #DemiLovatoIsOverParty to start trending.</h2><p>Which is probably why the flood of "Demi's over" tweets started just rolling in as fast as the purchases her fans make whenever the singer drops a new track.
