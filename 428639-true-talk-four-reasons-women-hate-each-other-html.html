They make rude remarks, give icy stares that would make the newcomer almost bury herself if she has no self-confidence.</p><p>Often times, there is that one woman who immediately turns into an ice queen upon the very sight of you, despite you having done absolutely nothing to wrong her in any way.</p><p>Unlike men, women will often dislike another woman for no logical reason at all. The female folks are quick to judge one another and they are less likely to become friends with someone who could be perceived as a sexual rival.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Marriage vs Career: Women Share Their Experiences</a></p><p>A number of ladies will tell you that they&nbsp;have survived at least one mean attack from another lady, who badmouthed their appearance, dismissed them or made them feel less than a human being.</p><p>If you’ve never done anything to another woman to warrant such cruel treatment from her, then it’s likely that she has some serious issues and she’s just taking them out on you. Don’t blame yourself or be worried about it, you’ve done nothing wrong.</p><p>The funny thing is that despite all the drama men create in women’s lives and or the amount of hurt or abuse they cause, the women keep loving them. They’d rather hate a fellow woman, who has done nothing to them. But why is it so, why do women hate each other so much?</p><p><strong>1. Jealousy</strong>: Most women, whether they admit it or not, like to have attention focused on them. If there's something taking it away from them, especially another woman, then she gets a little intimidated and typically starts to hate. Some women would hate you, if they think you’re prettier than them. Your mere presence makes them feel like ugly. If your dress looks prettier, they would hate. If they are single, they will see you as the competition. If they are married, they will see you as the seductive temptress trying to steal their man away.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Top-7 Reasons Why Some Nigerian Ladies Are Single&nbsp;</a></p><p><strong>2. Inferiority complex</strong>: Some ladies start to feel inferior when others are showered compliments and they are not. They start to hate the lady who received the compliment as if it was her fault. If another lady commands respect and they don’t they begin to hate.</p><p><strong>3. Pride</strong>: Some women have a little too much pride within themselves and therefore cannot like anyone who they perceive is better than them. It's okay to have a lot of self-esteem but a lot of women confuse it with pride.</p><p><strong>4. Insecurity</strong>: Some women are very insecure. They judge other women according to their insecurities and what makes them feel better about themselves.</p><p>Some say, it’s in a woman’s nature to be jealous of another women but a woman who knows her true self-worth can never be jealous of another. Not every woman has the habit of hating other women.</p><p>For women who have been attacked by others for no reason, just ignore them and keep being your awesome self. There are billions of people walking the surface of the earth, why be bothered over those hating you.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>10 Things You Probably Never Knew About Men And May Never Get To Know</a></p><p>For those who are in the habit of hating others, stop seeing other women as competition. You should not feel threatened by their confidence.</p><p>Your self-worth should not be measured by another woman’s beauty or confidence, so stop looking for reasons to hate every woman you meet.</p><p>You are beautiful just the way you are. Be proud of who are and your appearance. When you see a beautiful lady you should complement her rather than hate. You gain nothing by hating.</p><p>Life is too short, after all.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXOElWxwZqyiqrJuwMClomaen6q%2Fbr7EmqqopqNixLC5xKdkoZmkmnqmrcKhZKismJq%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f428639-true-talk-four-reasons-women-hate-each-other-html.html&text=True%20Talk%3a%20Four%20Reasons%20Women%20Hate%20Each%20Other&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f428639-true-talk-four-reasons-women-hate-each-other-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f428639-true-talk-four-reasons-women-hate-each-other-html.html&title=True%20Talk%3a%20Four%20Reasons%20Women%20Hate%20Each%20Other" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f428639-true-talk-four-reasons-women-hate-each-other-html.html&title=True%20Talk%3a%20Four%20Reasons%20Women%20Hate%20Each%20Other" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f428639-true-talk-four-reasons-women-hate-each-other-html.html&title=True%20Talk%3a%20Four%20Reasons%20Women%20Hate%20Each%20Other" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f428639-true-talk-four-reasons-women-hate-each-other-html.html&description=True%20Talk%3a%20Four%20Reasons%20Women%20Hate%20Each%20Other" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1308597-eddie-hearn-bio-age-height-net-worth-wife-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eddie Hearn bio: age, height, net worth, wife">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-and-blake-lively-friendship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift Gave Blake Lively a Shoutout in Her Grammys Acceptance Speech">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
